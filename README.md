# scale-borrow

Decode scale in a dynamic way but reasonably efficiently because rust can.

## Who this crate is not for

If you are targeting a few specific parachains --> use subxt

If you are targeting lots of parachains and just need something easy --> use scale-value (or https://github.com/virto-network/scales)

## Status

Very experimental
